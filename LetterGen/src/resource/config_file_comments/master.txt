File info:
This is the master config file.
It specifies the individual config files for the respective config groups.

Format info:
Lines starting with "#" or "!" are comment lines and are ignored by the program. However, values may contain "#" and/or "!".
Blank lines are ignored as well.
Configuration settings are specified as key-value pairs, separated by "=", ":", or whitespace.
If a line contains multiple non-consecutive whitespace characters, the first one is interpreted as key-value separator.
Consequently, keys cannot contain whitespace.
Leading whitespace is ignored for both keys and values.
Trailing whitespace is ignored for keys only.

Config files are assumed to be in the same directory as this master config file.
If a specified file does not exist, internal default values are used for the missing properties.
